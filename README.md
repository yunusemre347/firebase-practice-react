# hello

This project belongs to "PedroTech". I only made React,typescript practice by rewriting the code. I also learned how to use firebase.

This site suppose to show some context when you log in. BUT IT DOESNT WORK due to GitHub Pages doesn't natively support single page apps. 
I have better things to study right now but I will learn more about this topic in the future. Sorry about that.

In the meantime you can check my codes.
